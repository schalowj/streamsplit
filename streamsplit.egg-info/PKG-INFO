Description: # streamsplit
        A utility to extract TCP streams from (large) pcap files
        ```
        usage: streamsplit.py [-h] [-F FILTER] [-f] [-l] [-t] [-b BUFFER] filename
        
        positional arguments:
          filename              PCAP file to be analyzed
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -F FILTER, --filter FILTER
                                Comma delimited list of hosts (ip:port) to filter
                                results. You can use 'any' in place of an address or
                                port. Example: '192.168.0.1:any,192.168.0.2:53,any:80'
          -f, --filenames       Includes exported filenames in the stream listing.
          -l, --list            Produces list of streams without exporting them to
                                individual PCAP files (faster)
          -t, --notime          Removes timestamps from the stream listing.
          -b BUFFER, --buffer BUFFER
                                (advanced) Adjusts packet buffer sizes for export
                                files. Generally should be left alone.
